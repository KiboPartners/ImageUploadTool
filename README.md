# Kibo UCP Image Upload Tool

Add your tenant information into a file called `mozu.config.json`. There is a `mozu.config.json.example` that you can use as a reference.
Put files to upload in folder `toUpload`. If there is a file that exists with the same name already, the file will not upload.

To install dependencies, run:
    npm install
To run the script:
    node uploadFiles.js
